Use:
 ```
 # docker stop plex
 ```

don't need sudo... 

 ```
docker compose -f compose.yml up -d

or

docker compose up -d

 ```




Using this (similar to compose.yml that WORKS with GPU on the other usb-hdd disk)
do not work.

maybe is because there is no sudo?... but putting as sudo make like 'a new server'... is that ok?? do not override the data? change the folders maybe??
